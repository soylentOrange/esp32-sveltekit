A simple ESP32 based IoT project with a feature-rich, beautiful, and responsive front-end build with [Sveltekit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/). This project was generated from the great [ESP32-sveltekit template](https://github.com/theelims/ESP32-sveltekit) by [elims](https://github.com/theelims).

!!! info

    This project is just a bare minimum functional example. It is indended as a starting point for further projects in need of a rich web UI.
